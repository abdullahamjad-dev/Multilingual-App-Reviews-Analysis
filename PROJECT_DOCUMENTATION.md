## 🚧 **Current Limitations & Areas for Improvement**

### **1. Model Performance Limitations**
**Current Issue:** Rating prediction models show negative R² scores
**Root Cause:** 
- Subjective nature of ratings vs. text content
- Limited feature engineering from text
- Small dataset size for complex patterns

**Improvement Strategies:**
- **Advanced NLP:** Implement BERT/GPT embeddings for better text understanding
- **Feature Engineering:** Add user history, app metadata, review context
- **Ensemble Methods:** Combine multiple model types for better performance
- **Data Augmentation:** Expand dataset with more diverse reviews

### **2. Sentiment Analysis Bias**
**Current Issue:** Very few negative reviews (0.2%) creating class imbalance
**Impact:** Model may not generalize well to truly negative feedback

**Improvement Strategies:**
- **Data Balancing:** Collect more negative reviews or use synthetic generation
- **Cost-sensitive Learning:** Adjust model weights for rare classes
- **Active Learning:** Identify and label edge cases
- **External Validation:** Test on balanced external datasets

### **3. Cultural Context Understanding**
**Current Issue:** Limited deep cultural context in sentiment analysis
**Improvement Opportunities:**
- **Cultural Embeddings:** Train culture-specific sentiment models
- **Regional Lexicons:** Build region-specific positive/negative word lists
- **Cross-cultural Validation:** Test models across different cultural contexts
- **Anthropological Insights:** Incorporate cultural research into model design

### **4. Real-time Processing Scalability**
**Current Issue:** Dashboard processes data on-demand, may be slow for large datasets
**Improvement Strategies:**
- **Caching Layer:** Implement Redis for frequently accessed results
- **Batch Processing:** Pre-compute common analyses
- **Database Integration:** Move from CSV to proper database (PostgreSQL/MongoDB)
- **Microservices:** Split into specialized services for better scalability
