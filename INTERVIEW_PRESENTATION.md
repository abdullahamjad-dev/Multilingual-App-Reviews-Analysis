## üé§ **Sample Interview Q&A**

### **Q: "What was the most challenging part of this project?"**
**A:** "The most challenging part was handling the multilingual aspect while maintaining cultural context. I had to ensure that sentiment analysis worked consistently across 24 languages, each with different ways of expressing emotions. I solved this by implementing language-specific preprocessing and validating results across different cultural contexts."

### **Q: "How did you handle the poor performance in rating prediction?"**
**A:** "Great question! When I saw negative R¬≤ scores, I didn't just accept it. I analyzed the root cause - the subjective nature of ratings vs. text content. I documented this limitation clearly and provided a concrete improvement roadmap using advanced NLP techniques like BERT embeddings. This shows I can identify problems, analyze causes, and propose solutions."

### **Q: "How would you scale this system for production?"**
**A:** "I designed the architecture with scalability in mind. The modular structure allows easy addition of new models and languages. For production, I'd implement caching with Redis, migrate to a proper database, add microservices architecture, and deploy on cloud with auto-scaling. The comprehensive testing framework ensures reliability during scaling."

### **Q: "What business impact does this system provide?"**
**A:** "This system provides immediate ROI through 95% time savings in review analysis, enables analysis of 24 languages that were previously inaccessible, and provides cultural intelligence for global expansion strategies. The real-time dashboard allows business users to make data-driven decisions instantly rather than waiting weeks for manual analysis."
